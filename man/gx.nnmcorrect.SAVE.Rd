\title{Nearest neighbor matching batch correction}
\usage{
gx.nnmcorrect.SAVE(x, y, k = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric matrix of gene expression values (genes in rows, samples in columns).}

\item{y}{Factor vector indicating batch for each sample.}

\item{k}{Number of nearest neighbors to use (default 3).}
}
\value{
Batch corrected gene expression matrix.
}
\description{
Correct for batch effects in a gene expression matrix using nearest neighbor matching.
}
\details{
This function performs batch correction by matching each sample to its
k-nearest neighbors from other batches based on expression profile correlation.
The batch effect for a sample is estimated as the mean difference between it and its
matched neighbors. This difference is subtracted from the sample's expression profile.

\examples{
\dontrun{
x <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 30), 100, 30) # random expression matrix
y <- gl(3, 10) # 3 batches of 10 samples each
xcorr <- gx.nnmcorrect.SAVE(x, y)
}
