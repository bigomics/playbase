\title{Compute partial correlation matrix}
\usage{
pgx.computePartialCorrelationMatrix(tX, method = PCOR.METHODS, fast = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pgx}{A PGX object containing gene expression data.}

\item{covariates}{Character vector of covariate names to adjust for.}

\item{nsize}{Number of top connected genes to extract network. Default 0.}

\item{what}{Character vector specifying output elements. Default c("matrix", "graph").}

\item{gene}{Character vector of one or more genes to highlight. Default NULL.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
  \item rho - Matrix of partial correlations
  \item graph - igraph object of top connected genes
}
}
\description{
Computes a partial correlation matrix between genes adjusting for covariates.
}
\details{
This function calculates the partial correlation between all genes in the PGX expression matrix,
adjusting for the specified covariates. It removes the linear effect of the covariates before
computing the gene-gene partial correlations.

The main output is a partial correlation matrix. Optionally a graph can be extracted, showing the
top connected genes. Specific genes can be highlighted in the graph.
