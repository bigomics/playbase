\usage{
selectSamplesFromSelectedLevels(Y, levels)

selectSamplesFromSelectedLevels(Y, levels)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Data frame containing sample data.}

\item{levels}{Character vector of selected factor level descriptions in format 'factor=level'.}
}
\value{
A character vector of selected sample names.

A character vector of selected sample names.
}
\description{
Selects rows from a data frame corresponding to selected factor levels.

Selects rows from a data frame corresponding to selected factor levels.
}
\details{
This function takes a data frame Y containing sample data, and a character vector
levels defining a subset of factor levels to select. It parses the level descriptions,
identifies matching samples in Y, and returns the rownames of selected samples.

The levels should be strings in format 'factor=level' defining the
factor name and level value.  Samples in Y matching any of the
provided levels will be selected. Note: across factors samples as
intersected ('and' operator), within a factor samples are combined
('or' operator). Not very logical but this is what people in practice want.
