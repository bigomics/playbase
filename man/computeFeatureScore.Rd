\title{Compute feature scores}
\usage{
computeFeatureScore(X, Y, features)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix of expression data, with genes in rows and samples in columns.}

\item{Y}{Data frame containing sample metadata.}

\item{features}{Named list of gene sets (character vectors of gene names) to compute scores for.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of feature scores, with gene sets in rows and samples in columns.
}
\description{
Compute feature scores
}
\details{
This function computes a score for each specified gene set that
represents its average internal correlation within each sample group.

For each sample group, it takes the top 100 most variable genes in the gene set.
It then calculates the correlation distance matrix between these genes within that sample group.
The score is the mean of the upper triangle of the distance matrix.

Higher scores indicate the gene set has high internal correlation and is
coherently activated within that sample group.

# Generate random data
X <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 50), 100, 50)
Y <- data.frame(group = sample(letters[1:5], 50, replace = TRUE))
features <- list(
  feat1 = sample(rownames(X), 50),
  feat2 = sample(rownames(X), 50)
