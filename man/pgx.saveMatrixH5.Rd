}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The matrix to save}

\item{h5.file}{Path to the HDF5 file}

\item{chunk}{Chunk size for chunked storage. Default NULL for no chunking.}
}
\value{
NULL. The matrix is saved to the HDF5 file.

\description{
Saves a matrix to an HDF5 file for efficient storage and retrieval.
}
\details{
This function saves a matrix \code{X} to an HDF5 file at \code{h5.file}.
It first deletes any existing file at that path, then creates a new HDF5 file.

The matrix is saved under the "data/matrix" group. Chunked storage can be used
by specifying a \code{chunk} size. This allows efficient access of subsets of
the matrix.

The matrix is saved using lossless compression level 7. The HDF5 file remains
open after writing, and should be closed using \code{rhdf5::h5close()} after use.
