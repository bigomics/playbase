\usage{
fread.csv(
  file,
  check.names = FALSE,
  row.names = 1,
  sep = "auto",
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  header = TRUE,
  asMatrix = TRUE

}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to CSV file}

\item{check.names}{Logical, should column names be checked for syntactic validity. Default is FALSE.}

\item{row.names}{Column to use for row names, default is 1 (first column).}

\item{sep}{Separator character, default is "auto" for automatic detection.}

\item{stringsAsFactors}{Logical, should character columns be converted to factors? Default is FALSE.}

\item{header}{Logical, does the file have a header row? Default is TRUE.}

\item{asMatrix}{Logical, should the result be returned as a matrix instead of a data frame? Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A data frame or matrix containing the parsed CSV data.

\description{
Read CSV file into R efficiently
}
\details{
This function efficiently reads a CSV file into R using \code{data.table::fread()}, then converts it into a regular data frame or matrix.
It is faster than \code{read.csv()} especially for large files.

By default it converts the result to a matrix if all columns are numeric, character or integer. The row names are taken from the first column.
Factor conversion, column type checking, and header parsing can be controlled with parameters.
