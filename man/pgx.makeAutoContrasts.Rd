\title{Automatically generate contrasts from sample metadata}
\usage{
pgx.makeAutoContrasts(
  df,
  mingrp = 3,
  slen = 20,
  ref = NULL,
  fix.degenerate = FALSE,
  skip.hidden = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame with sample metadata}

\item{mingrp}{Minimum group size to include}

\item{slen}{Maximum contrast name length}

\item{ref}{Reference level for factors}

\item{fix.degenerate}{Fix degenerate designs?}

\item{skip.hidden}{Skip hidden metadata columns?}
}
\value{
A data frame with automatically generated contrasts
}
\description{
This function automatically generates contrasts for differential analysis from a 
data frame of sample metadata. It extracts factor columns, generates comparisons between
groups, handles dummy variable creation, and outputs a clean contrast matrix.
}
\details{
The sample metadata is scanned to find categorical variables with at least mingrp
groups. These are expanded into dummy variables and all pairwise comparisons between
groups are generated. Contrast names are cleaned and truncated to slen characters.

Degenerate designs are checked for and resolved if fix.degenerate=TRUE.
Metadata columns starting with "." are skipped if skip.hidden=TRUE.

The final output is a data frame with samples in rows, contrast columns, and values
of 0/1/-1 indicating the sample groups being compared. This defines the contrasts
for differential analysis.
