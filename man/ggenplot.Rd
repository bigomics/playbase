\title{Generate a GSEA enrichment plot with ggplot2}
\usage{
ggenplot(fc, gset, cex = 1, main = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fc}{A numeric vector of gene-level stats (e.g. log2 fold changes) ordered by decreasing statistic.}

\item{gset}{A character vector of gene ids in the gene set.}

\item{cex}{Point expansion factor, passed to ggplot2.}

\item{main}{Plot title text.}

\item{xlab}{X axis label text.}

\item{ylab}{Y axis label text.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object containing the enrichment plot.
}
\description{
This function takes a ranked list of gene-level stats and a gene set, and produces an enrichment plot visualization using ggplot2.
}
\details{
GSEA enrichment plot

It computes a running enrichment score based on the ranked gene list \code{fc} and gene set membership \code{gset}. The enrichment score shows if the gene set is enriched at either end of the ranked list. The plot is generated using ggplot2, with point size scaled by \code{cex}. Axis labels and plot title can be customized.
