\arguments{
\item{sig}{Gene expression matrix with genes in rows and samples in columns.}

\item{class.label}{Vector of group labels for each sample. Must have two unique values.}

\item{fdr}{FDR threshold for identifying differentially expressed genes.}

\item{test.method}{Test method to use. Options are "wilcox", "limma", "ttest", or "fisher".}

\item{running.name}{Optional name prefix for output files.}

\item{output.to.file}{Logical for writing results to file.}
}
\value{
Data frame with gene p-values and FDR.

\description{
Performs differential expression testing between two groups.
Supports wilcoxon, t-test, limma, and fisher's exact test.
}
\details{
Differential expression testing between groups

This function performs differential expression testing between two groups defined by \code{class.label}.
It handles filtering out NA values and outputs p-values and FDR for each gene.
The test method can be specified, with "limma" as the default.
