\arguments{
\item{X}{Expression matrix}

\item{Y}{Data frame of sample phenotypes}

\item{nv}{Number of principal components to use}

\item{stat}{Statistic for categorical phenotypes ("F" or "t").}

\item{plot}{Logical, whether to generate a PCA plot.}

\item{main}{Title for PCA plot.}
}
\value{
Named vector of correlation coefficients
}
\description{
Calculates the correlation between principal components of the expression matrix X
and sample phenotypes in Y.
}
\details{
This function calculates the top nv principal components of the expression matrix X
using irlba::irlba. It then correlates each PC with each phenotype in the Y data frame.

For categorical phenotypes, it converts to a factor and calculates the correlation with
the model matrix. For numeric phenotypes it calculates the standard correlation coefficient.

It returns a named vector of correlation coefficients, with names corresponding to
the phenotypes.
