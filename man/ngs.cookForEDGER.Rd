\title{Prepare count data for edgeR differential analysis}
\usage{
ngs.cookForEDGER(
  counts,
  samples = NULL,
  genes = NULL,
  normalization = "none",
  filter = TRUE,
  prior.cpm = 0,
  remove.batch = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Data frame with raw counts, or named list with counts, samples, and genes components.}

\item{samples}{Data frame with sample metadata, required if counts is just a matrix.}

\item{genes}{Data frame with gene metadata, required if counts is just a matrix.}

\item{normalization}{Normalization method to use, default is "none".}

\item{filter}{Logical indicating whether to filter low counts.}

\item{prior.cpm}{Filtering threshold for counts per million. Default is 0.}

\item{remove.batch}{Logical indicating whether to estimate and remove batch effects.}
}
\value{
A DGEList object ready for analysis with edgeR.
}
\description{
This function takes raw count data and prepares it for differential
expression analysis with edgeR. It handles filtering, normalization, and batch correction.
}
\details{
This function handles conversion of raw count data into a properly formatted
DGEList object for differential analysis with edgeR. It checks that the sample and gene
metadata matches the counts. Filtering, normalization, and batch correction can be applied.

The returned DGEList contains the normalized, filtered count matrix, along with sample and
gene data frames, ready for analysis with edgeR functions like glmQLFit() and glmQLFTest().
