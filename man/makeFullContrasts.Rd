\title{Generate contrasts between clusters}
\usage{
makeFullContrasts(labels, by.sample = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{by.sample}{Logical for sample-wise contrasts instead of cluster-wise}

\item{clusters}{Vector of cluster assignments}

\item{min.freq}{Minimum cluster frequency to include in contrasts}

\item{full}{Logical for whether to generate all pairwise contrasts}
}
\value{
Contrast matrix
}
\description{
Generates a contrast matrix for comparing clusters.
}
\details{
This function takes a vector of cluster assignments and generates a contrast matrix
encoding comparisons between each pair of clusters above the min.freq threshold.

The contrast matrix has clusters as rows and comparison columns with names like 
"cluster1_vs_cluster2". The matrix values are 1/-1 for the clusters being compared,  
and 0 otherwise.

If full=TRUE, all pairwise comparisons are generated instead of only adjacent clusters.
If by.sample=TRUE, the contrasts are encoded at the sample level instead of cluster level.
