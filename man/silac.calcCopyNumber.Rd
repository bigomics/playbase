\title{Calculate Copy Number from SILAC Data}
\usage{
silac.calcCopyNumber(data, mol.weight, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric matrix of SILAC data, where rows represent proteins and columns represent samples.}

\item{mol.weight}{A numeric vector of molecular weights for each protein.}

\item{y}{The mass of the cell in picograms (pg).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of the same dimensions as data, containing the calculated copy number for each protein and sample.
}
\description{
This function calculates the copy number of proteins from SILAC data, using the molecular weight and mass of the cell.
}
\details{
The function first calculates the total intensity for each sample by summing the intensities across all proteins, ignoring missing values.
Then, for each protein and sample, the function calculates the mass by multiplying the intensity by the mass of the cell and dividing by the total intensity.
The function then converts the mass to moles by dividing by the molecular weight and Avogadro's number.
