\title{Differential expression analysis with limma for RNA-seq data}
\usage{
seq_limma(countdata, y, method = "edgeR")
}
\arguments{
\item{countdata}{Numeric matrix of RNA-seq counts with genes in rows and 
samples in columns.}

\item{y}{Factor or vector indicating the phenotype for each sample.}

\item{method}{Method for normalization and dispersion estimation. Either 
"edgeR" or "DESeq2".}
}
\value{
Data frame containing limma analysis results.
}
\description{
Performs differential expression analysis on RNA-seq count data
 using limma-voom. Designed for gene-level count data from RNA-seq 
experiments.
}
\details{
Differential expression analysis using limma for RNA-seq data

This function takes RNA-seq count data and a phenotype factor as input.
 It uses limma-voom to fit a linear model and identify differentially expressed 
genes. The count data is normalized and dispersion is estimated using either edgeR or DESeq2 methods.
