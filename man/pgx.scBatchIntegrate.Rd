\usage{
pgx.scBatchIntegrate(
  X,
  batch,
  method = c("ComBat", "limma", "CCA", "MNN", "Harmony", "liger")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix of expression values, cells as columns}

\item{batch}{Factor specifying batch for each cell}

\item{method}{Methods to use for batch integration. Options are "ComBat", "limma", "CCA", "MNN", "Harmony", "liger"}
}
\value{
List containing batch-integrated expression matrices by method
}
\description{
Integrate single-cell RNA-seq data from multiple batches using various batch correction methods.
}
\details{
This function takes a single-cell expression matrix \code{X} and a batch vector \code{batch} as input.
It applies different batch correction methods to integrate the data across batches.
The following methods can be selected via the \code{method} parameter:
\itemize{
\item ComBat: Apply ComBat batch correction from sva package
\item limma: Apply removeBatchEffect from limma package
\item CCA: Apply canonical correlation analysis using Seurat package
\item MNN: Apply mutual nearest neighbors correction
\item Harmony: Apply Harmony integration using Harmony package
\item liger: Apply integration via liger package
}
The batch-integrated expression matrices are returned as a list by method name.
}
