\title{Normalize a contrasts matrix}
\usage{
normalizeContrasts(contr.matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{contr.matrix}{A contrasts matrix with groups as rows and comparisons as columns}
}
\value{
The normalized contrasts matrix
}
\description{
Normalizes a contrasts matrix to have zero row means and symmetric column sums.
}
\details{
This function normalizes a contrasts matrix in the following way:

- Subtracts the row means, centering each contrast around 0
- Divides each column by the absolute column sum, making columns symmetric sum-to-1
- Replaces any NA values with 0 

The result is a normalized contrasts matrix suitable for statistical testing.
