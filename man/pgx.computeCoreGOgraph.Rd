\details{
Compute Core GO Graph

This function takes a pgx object containing GO enrichment results 
and extracts significant GO terms below the specified FDR threshold. It constructs 
a graph where nodes are GO terms, connected based on their semantic relationships 
from the GO ontology. Terms are colored by their enrichment scores and sized by the 
number of input genes they contain. The resulting graph highlights the key GO 
terms and biological processes enriched in the analysis.
