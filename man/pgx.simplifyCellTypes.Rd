\title{Simplify cell types names}
\usage{
pgx.simplifyCellTypes(ct, low.th = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{ct}{Character vector of cell type names.}

\item{low.th}{Threshold to filter low abundance cell types.}
}
\value{
A character vector with simplified cell type names.
}
\description{
Simplifies cell types names from LM22, DICE, ImmProt and
ImmunoStates to standardized classification names.
}
\details{
This function takes a character vector of cell type names 
from deconvolution methods like LM22, DICE, ImmProt, ImmunoStates etc. 
It simplifies the names using pattern matching to map to standardized 
cell type categories like "T_cells", "B_cells", "Macrophages" etc.

Cell types below the abundance threshold `low.th` are removed.

\dontrun{
ct <- c("B.cells.Naive", "T.cells.CD8", "Macrophages.M2")
ct_simple <- pgx.simplifyCellTypes(ct)
print(ct_simple)
