\title{Normalize counts with TMM method}
\usage{
normalizeTMM(counts, log = FALSE, method = "TMM")
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Count matrix with genes in rows and samples in columns}

\item{log}{Logical, whether to log transform normalized counts}

\item{method}{Normalization method, default "TMM"}
}
\value{
Matrix of normalized counts
}
\description{
Normalizes a count matrix using the TMM (Trimmed Mean of M-values) method.
}
\details{
This function takes a count matrix and normalizes the counts using the TMM method
implemented in the edgeR package.

It converts the count matrix to a DGEList object. Then it calculates normalization
factors using the calcNormFactors function with default TMM method.

The normalized counts are returned as CPM values, optionally log-transformed.

\dontrun{
counts <- matrix(rnbinom(100, mu = 10, size = 1), ncol = 10)
norm_counts <- normalizeTMM(counts)
}
