\title{Extract gene-specific subgraph from PubMed network}
\usage{
pmid.extractGene(gr, gene, nmin = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{An igraph network object generated from PubMed data}

\item{gene}{Character vector of gene symbols to extract network for}

\item{nmin}{Minimum number of genes in connected components to keep}
}
\value{
An igraph object containing the gene-specific subgraph
}
\description{
Extracts a subgraph related to the specified genes from a PubMed network graph.
}
\details{
This function takes a PubMed network graph \code{gr} and a vector of \code{gene} symbols. 
It extracts the nodes containing those genes and the edges between them.  
Connected components with fewer than \code{nmin} genes are removed.

Edge weights and gene annotations are added to the subgraph.
