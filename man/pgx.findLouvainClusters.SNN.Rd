\description{
Clusters samples using a shared nearest neighbor graph and Louvain clustering.
}
\details{
Find Louvain clusters using shared nearest neighbor graph


This function constructs a shared nearest neighbor graph from the expression matrix, 
where samples are connected if they appear in each other's k-nearest neighbor lists.

Louvain clustering is then applied to detect communities in the graph. The resolution 
parameter controls the number and size of clusters.

The output is a vector of cluster assignments for each sample.
