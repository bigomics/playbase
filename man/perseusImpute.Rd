\description{
Imputes missing values using Perseus-style imputation.
Draw from a narrow Gaussian distribution, which is down-shifted toward
lower intensities to simulate values below the detection limit.
Default Perseus parameters are width=0.3 and down shift = 1.8 (log2 scale)
from the mean of the observed data distribution. This is commonly used in
proteomics where missing values often reflect low abundance. By imputing
from a left-shifted distribution (mu-shift*sigma), the function reflects
the assumption that missing values tend to be lower than observed ones.
