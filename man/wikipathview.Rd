\title{Download and color nodes in WikiPathways SVGs}
\usage{
wikipathview(wp, val)
}
\arguments{
\item{wp}{A character string specifying the WikiPathways pathway ID.}

\item{val}{A named numeric vector where names correspond to pathway element IDs, 
and values represent the level of regulation (e.g., fold-change or intensity). 
Positive values indicate up-regulation, while negative values indicate down-regulation.}
}
\value{
A character string representing the path to the modified SVG file, 
        or `NULL` if the download fails.
}
\description{
Downloads a WikiPathways SVG file, modifies its XML structure to color pathway nodes 
according to regulation values, and returns the path to the modified file.
}
\details{
The function downloads the SVG representation of a WikiPathways pathway, modifies its 
XML content to color pathway nodes based on the provided `val` parameter:
- **Positive values**: Nodes are colored red, with the intensity increasing as the value grows.
- **Negative values**: Nodes are colored blue, with the intensity increasing as the absolute value grows.

Opacity is determined by the square root of the absolute value, scaled and capped at a maximum of 1.

Nodes with IDs matching the names in `val` are colored accordingly. Nodes without matching IDs 
or `val` values are left unchanged.
