\usage{
pgx.computeConnectivityScores(
  pgx,
  sigdb,
  ntop = 200,
  contrasts = NULL,
  remove.le = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pgx}{PGX object containing gene expression data}

\item{sigdb}{Signature database HDF5 file}

\item{ntop}{Number of top correlated genes to use for scoring. Default 1000.}

\item{contrasts}{Contrasts to compute signature for. Default is all contrasts.}

\item{remove.le}{Remove leading edge genes before scoring. Default FALSE.}
}
\value{
List of data frames with connectivity scores for each contrast.
}
\description{
Compute connectivity scores between a signature and datasets.
}
\details{
This function takes a signature from the PGX object (fold changes for a given contrast)
and computes connectivity scores against the signature database. The signature is correlated
against all datasets in the database to produce a ranked list of connectivity scores.

The top \code{ntop} correlated genes are used for computing the connectivity score.
Scores are computed for each contrast unless a subset is specified with \code{contrasts}.

Setting \code{remove.le = TRUE} removes the leading edge genes from the signature before
computing connectivity. This reduces bias from highly weighted genes.
