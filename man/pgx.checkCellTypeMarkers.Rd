\title{Check Cell Type Markers}
\usage{
pgx.checkCellTypeMarkers(counts, min.count = 3, markers = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Gene expression matrix with genes in rows and samples in 
columns.}

\item{min.count}{Minimum expression count threshold. Default 3.}

\item{markers}{Named list of cell type marker genes.}
}
\value{
Named list with logical vectors indicating detected (TRUE) vs undetected 
(FALSE) markers for each cell type.
}
\description{
Checks if known cell type marker genes are detected (positive markers) 
or not detected (negative markers) in a gene expression matrix.
}
\details{
This function takes a gene expression matrix and checks if known cell type 
marker genes are detected above a minimum expression threshold (positive markers) 
or not detected (negative markers). 

It compares the matrix rownames against lists of known canonical markers for major 
immune and cancer cell types. Markers can be specified, otherwise built-in 
canonical markers are used.  

For each cell type, it identifies the positive and negative markers based on 
expression above or below min.count. This provides an overview of which cell types 
are potentially present or absent based on their expression markers in the data.
