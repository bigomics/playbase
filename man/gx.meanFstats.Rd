\title{Calculate mean F statistics}
\usage{
gx.meanFstats(X, pheno)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A gene expression matrix with genes in rows and samples in columns.}

\item{pheno}{A phenotype factor or vector indicating the phenotype of each sample.}
}
\value{
The mean F statistic across all genes.
}
\description{
Calculates the mean F statistic across all genes from running limma differential expression analysis.
Useful for comparing overall separation between groups.
}
\details{
Calculate mean F statistics from limma differential expression analysis

Runs limma differential expression between the phenotype groups for each gene. 
Extracts the F statistics from the limma results and calculates the mean F statistic across all genes.
Higher mean F indicates better separation between phenotype groups.
