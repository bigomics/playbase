\details{
Make contrast matrix from label matrix

This function takes a matrix of sample labels as input, where the column 
names indicate the sample groups being compared (e.g. "Group1_vs_Group2"). It parses 
the column names to extract the two groups, then constructs a contrast matrix by 
assigning +1/-1 weights to samples belonging to each group.

The resulting contrast matrix has rows corresponding to samples, and columns 
corresponding to the label matrix column names. This encodes the contrasts between
each pair of groups.
