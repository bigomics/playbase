\title{Plot expression of two genes across cell types}
\usage{
pgx.cytoPlot(
  pgx,
  gene1,
  gene2,
  cex = 1,
  col = "grey60",
  lab.unit = NULL,
  cex.names = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{pgx}{A PGX object containing single-cell expression data and inferred cell types.}

\item{gene1}{First gene name or ID to plot.}

\item{gene2}{Second gene name or ID to plot.}

\item{cex}{Point size scaling factor. Default is 1.}

\item{col}{Point color. Default is "grey60".}

\item{lab.unit}{Units for axis labels, eg 'log2(TPM)'. Default is NULL.}

\item{cex.names}{Text size for sample labels. Default is 1.}

\item{samples}{Vector of sample names to highlight. Default is NULL.}

\item{k}{Number of contour levels if drawing density contours. Default is 11.}
}
\value{
A scatter plot is generated showing the expression distribution of the two genes across cell types.
}
\description{
Generates a scatter plot showing the expression levels of two genes across inferred cell types.
}
\details{
This function takes a PGX object containing single-cell expression data and inferred cell types.
It extracts the expression values for the two specified genes, and generates a scatter plot 
with each cell as a point colored by its annotated cell type. Contour lines indicate the density distribution.
Sample names can be highlighted, and axis labels customized.
