\title{Generate design matrix for expression data}
\usage{
pgx.expMatrix(pheno, contr.matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{pheno}{Data frame containing sample metadata}

\item{contr.matrix}{Contrast matrix defining comparisons of interest}
}
\value{
Design matrix for expression data analysis
}
\description{
Generates a design matrix for expression data based on sample metadata and contrasts.
}
\details{
This function takes a data frame of sample metadata and a contrast matrix as input.
It constructs a model matrix with columns for the metadata variables, followed by 
columns encoding the contrasts of interest.

The result is a design matrix that can be used directly in differential expression
analysis with the expression data.
