\description{
Performs differential expression analysis using limma for data with two factorial designs.
Designed for experiments with two factors, each with two or more levels.
}
\details{
Differential expression analysis for two factorial designs

This function handles the limma model matrix and contrasts for two factorial designs.
The \code{factors} data frame specifies the experimental design.
Multiple contrasts are performed between factor level combinations.
Results are filtered by FDR and fold change thresholds.
