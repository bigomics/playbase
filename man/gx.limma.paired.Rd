\item{pair}{Factor vector indicating which samples are paired.}

\item{fdr}{FDR threshold for identifying differentially expressed genes.}

\item{lfc}{Log2 fold change cutoff for differential expression.}

\item{ref}{Character vector of reference levels to use as baseline in contrasts.}

\value{

\description{
Performs differential expression analysis using limma on paired or repeated measurement data.
Designed for pre-post, treated-untreated, or matched designs with two measurements per sample.
}
\details{
Differential expression analysis for paired data

This function handles the limma model matrix and contrasts for paired designs.
The \code{pair} vector indicates which samples are paired measurements.
A differential expression analysis is performed between the phenotype classes.
Results are filtered by FDR and fold change thresholds.
